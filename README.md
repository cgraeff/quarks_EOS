# Quarks EOS

This code calculates the Equations of State for quarks following M. Buballa, NJL-model analysis of dense quark matter, Physics Reports 407 (2005) 205-376.

## Requisites

To build and run this code, a C compiler and the GSL (GNU Scientific Library) must be installed on the system. The location of GSL headers and libraries is assumed to be `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib` on Mac OS. On Linux it should just work.

## Build and run instructions

* The directory structure is important, as they are not created automatically;
* Build with 'make';
* Run with 'make run';
* Arguments may be passed with 'make ARGS="-p Set -t" run', where '-p Set -t' stand for example arguments; Set stand for the name of a parameterization identifier (see Parameters.c for the available sets);
* Run tests with 'make tests' (it is a shortcut to 'make ARGS="-t"' with the default parameterization);
* Make graphics with 'make graph';
