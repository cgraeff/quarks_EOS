# Quarks EOS

This code calculates the Equations of State for quarks according the SU(2)
version of the NJL model. As references we use (Buballa 1996) and (Buballa 2005).

## Requisites

To build and run this code `make`, a C compiler (default is `gcc`) and the
GSL (GNU Scientific Library) must be installed on the system.

On Linux the installation varies from distribution to distribution, but generally
there are two packages, one for regular use and one for developing.
The development version is the one needed for compilation of this code.

On OSX, the location of GSL headers and libraries is assumed to be
`/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib`. This is the default if GSL is
installed from Homebrew. To change, edit the variables at `src/Makefile`.

## Build and run instructions

Basic build (generate `qeos`executable):
* Build with `make` in the top dir;

Running:
* When executed, `qeos` will calculate the equations of state with the
  default parameterization;
* The following options are available:
 * `-p par`: uses `par` parameters set;
 * `-t val`: uses `val` for temperature value. Must be a `double` value;
 * `-l`: list available parameters set;
 * `-q`: quiet (supress information written to standard out);
 * `-d`: write results using a dir structure;
 * `-a`: run tests. Automatically sets `-d`;
 * `-u`: prints usage;
 * `-h`: also prints usage;

For easier running and testing, the following commands are provided:
* Run with `make run` (implies `-d`);
* Remove product files with `make clean`;
* Arguments may be passed with `make ARGS="-p Set" run`, where `-p Set`
  stand for example arguments;
* Run tests with `make tests` (it is a shortcut to `make ARGS="-a" run` with
  the default parameterization);

When running on the default tree (that is, on the cloned dir), the
results can be plotted with
* Plot results with `make graph`
* Plot tests with `make tgraph`;

## Code structure

### Parameters

Parameters sets must be declared in `ParametersSetup()` in `Parameters.c`.
Each parameters set is cloned from a reference set with
`NewCopyOfParametersSetFromTemplate()` then the variables which differ from the
template are set. Each parameters set must have a unique identifier. Finally, the
set must be appendend to the list using `AppendParametersSetToList()`.

To choose a parameters set, the function `SetParametersSet()` must be used. This is
used before the calculation of the main results and if no parameters set is
explicitly requested in the command line, the first set declared is used. Each test
in `Tests()` (in `Tests.c`) should declare a set.

Once set using `SetParametersSet()`, use `parameters.a_parameter` to access the
parameters values, where `a_parameter` is one of the parameters declared in the
struct in `Parameters.h`.

### Commandline options

The commandline options set in `CommandlineOptions.*` are globally available using
`options.an_option`.

### Tests

Tests should be declared in the function `RunTests()` in `Tests.c`. This function is
executed when the executable is called with `-a` option.

### Files and paths

Paths can be easily set with `SetFilePath()`. After that, all files created with
`OpenFile()` will be created at that path. After a section of code that uses
`SetFilePath()`, the path should be reset to the working dir with
`SetFilePath(NULL)`. This is important as other sections of code may expect to write
in the working dir while using `OpenFile()` and this is accomplished with a `NULL`
path.
